## Part 11: GROUP BY  
GROUP BY clause is used to group a selected set of rows into a set of summary rows by the values of one or more columns or
expressions. It is always used in conjunction with one or more aggregate functions.    
__Creating the table__
```
CREATE TABLE tblEmployee
(
  ID INT PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL IDENTITY,
  Name VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
  Gender VARCHAR(6) NOT NULL CHECK(Gender IN('Male','Female')),
  Salary INT NOT NULL,
  City VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL
)
```
__Inset multiple records into the table__  
```
INSERT INTO tblEmployee VALUES
('TOM', 'Male', 4000, 'London'),
('Pam', 'Female', 3000, 'New York')
```
__Select the total salary paid to all employees__   
```
SELECT SUM(Salary) FROM tblEmployee
```
__Select the maximum salary paid to employees__  
```
SELECT MAX(Salary) FROM tblEmployee
```
__Select total salaries by city__
```
SELECT City, SUM(Salary) AS TotalSalary FROM tblEmployee GROUP BY City
```
__Select total salaries by city and gender__
```
SELECT City, Gender, SUM(Salary) as TotalSalary FROM tblEmployee
GROUP BY City, Gender
```
This is am example of multiple column GROUP BY
__Select total salarries by city and gender and total employees in each group__  
```
SELECT City, Gender, SUM(Salary) as TotalSalary, COUNT(Name) AS [Total Employee]
FROM tblEmployee
GROUP BY City, Gender
```
This is an example of using multiple aggregate function. The square bracket is used because of the space in the 'Total Employee' column name.

__To filer the group grouped selection use the WHERE clause or the HAVING clause__
Using the WHERE clause  
```
SELECT City, SUM(Salary) as TotalSalary, COUNT(ID) as [Total Employee]
FROM tblEmployee
WHERE Gender= 'Male'
GROUP BY City
```
Using the HAVING clause  
```
SELECT City, Gender, SUM(Salary) as TotalSalary, COUNT(ID) AS [Total Employee]
FROM tblEmployee
GROUP BY City, Gender
HAVING Gender='Female'
```
Difference between the WHERE and HAVING clause  
1. WHERE clause is used to filter rows before aggregation or grouping, whereas, HAVING clause is used to filter groups after aggregations are performed.   
2. WHERE clause can ne used with SELECT, INSERT and UPDATE statements, whereas, HAVING clause can only be used with the SELECT statement.   
3. Aggregation functions cannot be used in the WHERE clause, unless it is in a sub query contained in a HAVING clause, whereas, aggregate functions can b used in HAVING clause.  

## Part 12: Join in SQL Server  
Join in SQL Server are used to retrieve data from 2 or more related tables. In general tables are related to each other using foreign key constraints.  
In SQL Server, ther are differnet types of JOINs
1. INNER JOIN  
2. OUTER JOIN  
3. CROSS JOIN  

OUTER JOIN are divided into
1. LEFT JOIN or LEFT OUTER JOIN  
2. RIGHT JOIN or RIGHT OUTER JOIN  
3. FULL JOIN or FUL OUTER JOIN  

__Creating Department table__   
```
CREATE TABLE tblDepartment
(
  ID INT PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL IDENTITY,
  DepartmentName VARCHAR(30) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  Location VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
  DepartmentHead VARCHAR(15) NOT NULL
)
```
__Add foreign key column to tblEmployee table__  
```
ALTER TABLE tblEmployee
ADD DepartmentId INT NULL
CONSTRAINT FK_tblEmployee_DepartmentId FOREIGN KEY(DepartmentId)  
REFERENCES tblDepartment(ID)
```
Insert records into the tblDepartment table  
```
INSERT INTO tblDepartment VALUES
('IT', 'London', 'Rick'),
('Payroll', 'Delhi', 'Ron')
```
__Update tblEmployees with values for the new DepartmentId column__  
```
UPDATE tblEmployee SET DepartmentId=1  WHERE ID IN(1, 3, 6, 8)
UPDATE tblEmployee SET DepartmentId=2 WHERE ID IN (4, 5
UPDATE tblEmployee SET DepartmentId=3 WHERE ID IN (2, 7)
```
__Add two records with NULL value for the DepartmentId column__  
```
INSERT INTO tblEmployee VALUES
('James', 'Male', 6500, 'Lagos', NULL),
('Russell', 'Male', 8800, 'Lagos', NULL)
```
### INNER JOIN or JOIN
Only records that having an intersection, at the foreign key will be included.
Record whose foreign key value is not present in the parent table will not be included.  
Example:  
```
SELECT Name, Gender, Salary, DepartmentName
FROM tblEmployee
INNER JOIN tblDepartment
ON tblEmployee.DepartmentId = tblDepartment.ID
```
You will find that the record with DepartmentId=NULL is not included in the results as their DepartmentId does not have corresponding ID in tblDepartment table.  
The clause `JOIN` may be used in place of `INNER JOIN`.  

### LEFT OUTER JOIN or LEFT JOIN
To make sure all the record in the first table is included, use the LEFT OUTER JOINT.  
Example:  
```
SELECT Name, Gender, Salary, DepartmentName
FROM tblEmployee
LEFT OUTER JOIN tblDepartment
ON tblEmployee.DepartmentId = tblDepartment.ID
```
The clause `LEFT JOIN` may be used in place of `LEFT OUTER JOIN`  

### RIGHT OUTER JOIN or RIGHT JOIN  
To make sure all the record in the second table is featured in the selection, use RIGH OUTER JOIN.
Example:  
```
SELECT Name, Gender, Salary, DepartmentName
FROM tblEmployee
RIGHT OUTER JOIN tblDepartment
ON tblEmployee.DepartmentId = tblDepartment.ID
```
The clause `RIGHT JOIN` maybe used in place of `RIGHT OUTER JOIN`  

### FULL OUTER JOIN or FULL JOIN
This will creat a union(as in set notation), between the records of the two tables. No record is left behind.  
Example:  
```
SELECT Name, Gender, Salary, DepartmentName
FROM tblEmployee
FULL OUTER JOIN tblDepartment
ON tblEmployee.DepartmentId = tblDepartment.ID
```
In place of `FULL OUTER JOIN` you may use `FULL JOIN`  

### CROSS JOIN  
CROSS JOIN produces the cartesian product of the 2 tables involved in the join. For example, in the Employee table we have 10rows and in the Departments table we have 4 rows. So, a cross join between these 2 tables produces 40 rows.
A cross join do not have ON clause.  
Example:  
```
SELECT Name, Gender, Salary, DepartmentName
FROM tblEmployee
CROSS JOIN tblDepartment
```

## Part 13: Advanced JOIN in SQL Server  
The queries in the basic joins of part 12 all includes the matching rows or intersections.    
In this advanced query we seek the non matching rows only.  

__Select only employees with no department record__  
```
SELECT Name, Gender, City, DepartmentName
FROM tblEmployee
LEFT JOIN tblDepartment
ON tblEmployee.DepartmentId = tblDepartment.ID
WHERE tblEmployee.DepartmentId IS NULL
```
__Select only departments that have no employees__  
```
SELECT Name, Gender, Salary, DepartmentName
FROM tblEmployee
RIGHT JOIN tblDepartment
ON tblEmployee.DepartmentID = tblDepartment.ID
WHERE tblEmployee.DepartmentId IS NULL
```  
__Select employees with no department or department s with no employees__   
```
SELECT Name, Gender, Salary, DepartmentName
FROM tblEmployee
FULL JOIN tblDepartment
ON tblEmployee.DepartmentId = tblDepartment.ID
WHERE tblEmployee.DepartmentId IS NULL
OR tblDepartment.ID IS NULL
```

## Part 14: Self Join in SQL Server  
Have you ever had thought of a need to join a table with itself?.  
__Create the table__  
```
CREATE TABLE tblWorkers
(
  EmployeeID INT NOT NULL IDENTITY,
  Name VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
  ManagerID INT NULL
)
```
__Seed the table__  
```
INSERT INTO tblWorkers VALUES('Mike', 3), ('Rob', 1), ('Todd', NULL), ('Ben', 1), ('Sam', 1)
```
__Joining the table to itself__  
```
SELECT W.Name AS Employee, M.Name AS Manager
FROM tblWorkers W
LEFT JOIN tblWorkerS M
ON W.ManagerID = M.EmployeeID
```
Joining a table with itself is called self join.   
Self join is similar to the regular join. It can also be classified under any of the types:  
1) INNER JOIN  
2) OUTER JOIN (LEFT, RIGHT, FULL)
3) CROSS JOIN  


## Part 15: Different ways to replace NULL in SQL Server  
Three ways to replace NULL values:  
* ISNULL() function
* CASE statement
* COALESCE() function  

__Using ISNULL() to replace NULL value__  
```
SELECT W.Name AS Employee, ISNULL(M.Name, 'No Manager') AS Manager
FROM tblWorkers W
LEFT JOIN tblWorkers M
ON W.ManagerID = M.EmployeeID
```
__Using COALESCE() to replace NULL value__  
COLESCEE() function is similar to ISNULL() but it can take multiple values and returns the first non NULL value.      
```
SELECT W.Name AS Employee, COALESCE(M.Name, 'No Manager') AS Manager
FROM tblWorkers W
LEFT JOIN tblWorkers M
ON W.ManagerID = M.EmployeeID
```
__Using the CASE statement to replace NULL value__  
The syntax for the CASE statement is  
```
CASE WHEN Expression THEN 'Value1' ELSE 'Value2' END
```
Example   
```
SELECT W.Name AS Employee, CASE WHEN M.Name IS NULL THEN 'No Manager' ELSE M.Name END AS Manager
FROM tblWorkers W
LEFT JOIN tblWorkers M
ON W.ManagerID = M.EmployeeID
```

## Part 16: Coalesce function in SQL Server  
COALESCE() function - Returns the first NON NULL value  
```
SELECT ID, COALESCE(FirstName, MiddleName, LastName) as Name FROM tblEmployee
```
